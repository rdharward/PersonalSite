          <h2>Fujifilm</h2>
			<p>My work with Fujifilm was in the development of the interface for medical radiology imaging and information management system program Synapse. My team worked in an Agile environment, where we performed many different kinds of testing as both individuals and as a group. A normal work day would consist of several different styles of tests performed on specific pieces of the program. I compiled presentations together that would show exactly what ways I would test the new feature, or a previously fixed feature, and would receive additional ideas from the rest of my scrum members after which I would begin testing. I collaborated with the other team members in the same manner every day.</p>

		  <p>At AT&T I was primarily involved in the development of one of AT&T’s workflow programs SASHA.  Customers call in to report issues, and AT&T’s first contact agents would follow the SASHA's interface to direct the agent towards solving the customer's problem.  Due to AT&T’s vast amount of customers, there was a lot of development and creating solutions for different issues, departments, areas, and types of services.I worked with Linux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Motive (a tool designed to assist with workflow development), JUEL, and various server side debugging tools. I designed parts of the program requested by the agents, wrote engineering documents, and tested different features. </p>
