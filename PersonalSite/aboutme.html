			<h2>Personal Life</h2>		
				<p>I am a pretty fun loving guy. Durham, NC has been my home for all of my life outside of college. I grew up with 2 younger siblings and being the first of my generation was fortunate enough to be around great grandparents. Southern hospitality is our thing. I grew up around kind people that loved cooking food for people. In my opinion, and by my personal experiences elsewhere, our town has the best food in the country. I love Football. I only missed 2 home games in my entire 4 years of college at ASU. I grew up going to Duke and ECU games as well.</p>

			<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
				<p> In high school I took an online visual basic programming course being offered online to other students at my school. It was a work at your own pace class and the class had a proctor in the room but no real teacher. I worked ahead of schedule until I was finished with the 90 day class in about 45 days and first to finish the course. I ended up teaching the majority of the class on visual basic and helping in a way that the online teacher could not. My comprehension of programming was so different from the other students that I decided at the end of the course that I would go to school for Computer Science.</p>

          <h3>How I learn...</h3>
				<p>I use the service TeamTreeHouse to learn computer science! Its has thousands of hours of online courses in virtually every computer language, framework, tool, or technology that there is. They have lectures, examples, quizzes, and projects. There are even assistants who will help you in realtime. While it is paid for it is a very useful service and will help you learn any programming technology you could possibly need.</p>

			<h2>Chocolate Chip</h2>
			<p>Our very sweet, pretty, and photogenic Yorkshire Terrier. We call him lots of different names like Shiny Monkey(dont ask), Tooty-Moe-Rooty, and Chicken (because he is scared of the most random things). Unlike most Yorkies his hair never really turned color that much so even though hes an old man now most people still think he is a puppy. </p>

			<h2>Little-Kitty</h2>
			<p>Im serious...we could not agree on a name for this cat. Because she was so much smaller than our other cat we just called her Little-Kitty and it hasnt changed since. She is a cuddly and friendly to everyone in the family but me.  She is mischievous and likes to steal small things and she begs for attention by doing things she knows we dont like.</p>

			<h2>Lou</h2>
			<p>Our most laid back and dont care about anything cat. She just showed up at our door starving on Thanksgiving. My siblings convinced my dad to let her stay until we found her owner.  We never did. My mother would often ponder "kitty lou who do you belong to" in a rhyming way. I said after she had been there a while to call her Lou and the name stuck.</p>
